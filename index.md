# Introduction

Here we show how to generate the hydrodynamic evolution auto-regressively with diffusion model.



* The hydrodynamic evolution history serves as a crucial background in heavy-ion physics, which is governed by the relativistic hydrodynamic equations.  
* This project focuses on training a diffusion model to generate such evolution histories, analogous to solving a video generation task in physics.
* By modeling the current profile as conditioned on the previous one, the diffusion model learns the conditional distributions, enabling auto-regressive sampling of the evolution process. 
* The energy conservation law is enforced during training, and additional physical constraints are applied during sampling. This ensures the model follows physical laws, as demonstrated by evaluating the L2 loss and key observables.

# Method
The relativistic hydrodynamics is described by the conversation equation, coulped with the equation of state.

$$
\begin{align}
\partial_\mu T^{\mu\nu} &= 0\\
P &= P(e)
\end{align}.
$$

We model the hydrodynamics evolution auto-regressively,

$$
p(T^{\mu\nu}_{1:\tau_{fo}}|T^{\mu\nu}_{0}) = \prod _{\tau=1}^{\tau_{fo}}p(T^{\mu\nu}_{\tau}|T^{\mu\nu}_{\tau-1}).
$$

Thus, our target is to train diffusion model to learn the conditional distributions,

$$
p(T^{\mu\nu}_{\tau}|T^{\mu\nu}_{\tau-1}).
$$

For better training, we notice that the energy conversion law, i.e., $\int dx dy \tau T^{\tau\tau}$ . 
Although, it is not strictly conserved, it serves as a good scaler. So, the

$$ p(\tau T^{\mu\nu}_{\tau}|\tau T^{\mu\nu}_{\tau-1}).$$ 

is trained.

# Examples
The first row is the ground truth. The second row is the generated by our trained model. From left to right, it is $T^{\tau\tau}$, $T^{\tau x}$, and $T^{\tau y}$.

* Change the equation of state
* Evaluate the model by compare eccentricity $\varepsilon_n$
